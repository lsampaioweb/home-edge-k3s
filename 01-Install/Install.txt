01 - Create UFW rules.
  ufw allow 6443/tcp #apiserver
  ufw allow from 10.42.0.0/16 to any #pods
  ufw allow from 10.43.0.0/16 to any #services

02 - Configuration with install script:
  By default, values present in a YAML file located at /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml will be used on install.

  nano /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml

03 - Install Script.
  K3s provides an installation script that is a convenient way to install it as a service on systemd or openrc based systems. This script is available at https://get.k3s.io.
  A kubeconfig file will be written to /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml and the kubectl installed by K3s will automatically use it.

  Accessing the Cluster from Outside with kubectl:
  Copy /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml on your machine located outside the cluster as ~/.kube/config. Then replace the value of the server field with the IP or name of your K3s server. kubectl can now manage your K3s cluster.

  To install K3s using this method, just run:
  curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

04 - Install agent nodes.
  To install additional agent nodes and add them to the cluster, run the installation script with the K3S_URL and K3S_TOKEN environment variables.
  Setting the K3S_URL parameter causes the installer to configure K3s as an agent, instead of a server. The K3s agent will register with the K3s server listening at the supplied URL. The value to use for K3S_TOKEN is stored at /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on your server node.
  Each machine must have a unique hostname. If your machines do not have unique hostnames, pass the K3S_NODE_NAME environment variable and provide a value with a valid and unique hostname for each node.

  Here is an example showing how to join an agent:
  curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://msyserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=mynodetoken sh -
