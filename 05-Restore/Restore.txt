In this example there are 3 servers, S1, S2, and S3. The snapshot is located on S1.

01 - On S1:

  k3s server \
    --cluster-reset \
    --cluster-reset-restore-path=<PATH-TO-SNAPSHOT>

02 - On S2 and S3:

  systemctl stop k3s
  rm -rf /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db/

03 - On S1:
  systemctl start k3s

04 - On S2 and S3:
  systemctl start k3s

05 - Prune local snapshots:
  The prune subcommand takes an additional flag --snapshot-retention that allows for overriding the default retention policy.

  k3s etcd-snapshot prune
